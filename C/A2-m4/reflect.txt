While doing the milestone 1, 2, 3 and 4, I have learned managing arrays, pointers and value passed by the arrays using pointers. I have learned that arrays can be passed by using the & and pointers to use the values in it. Also, I have learned that structures that are declared in the helpers function is useful for the code readability and making it is easy to use.

The functions getTenDigitPhone in very useful in checking in that the number user entered is within the range and the number is not containing a character. Find contact index is a very useful function which helps in finding a string using its index or an similar variable content. It helps you find the specific string or array index you are searching for.

In this assignment functions helped a lot. For me they were pretty mandatory as one always want to repeat some of the functions a couple of time and save or delete data accordingly. One cannot write the whole code in a single loop without an error. Also the helpers and headers helps a lot as it contains lots of data that is manageable by the .c files.
